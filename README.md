# Donut Examples

This repository provides a collection of example applications built using the [Donut framework](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/donut).

| [Vertex Buffer](examples/vertex_buffer)                   | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | Creates a vertex buffer for a cube and draws the cube. |
| [Work Graphs](examples/work_graphs)                       |                    | :white_check_mark: |                    | Demonstrates the new D3D12 work graphs API via a tiled deferred shading renderer that dynamically chooses shaders for each screen tile. Requires CMake define `INCLUDE_WORKGRAPHS_EXAMPLE=ON`. |

## Requirements

Same as the [requirements for Donut](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/donut).

## Build

1. Clone the repository **with all submodules**:
   
   `git clone --recursive <URL>`
   
2. Create a build folder.

   `cd donut_examples && mkdir build && cd build`

   * Any name works, but git is configured to ignore folders named 'build\*'
   * This folder should be placed under directory created by 'git clone' in step #1

3. Use CMake to configure the build and generate the project files.
   
   * Linux: `cmake ..`
   * Windows: use of CMake GUI is recommended. Make sure to select the x64 platform for the generator.

4. Build the solution generated by CMake in the build folder.

   * Linux: `make -j8` (example for an 8-core CPU)
   * Windows: Open the generated solution with Visual Studio and build it.

5. Run the examples. They should be built in the `bin` folder.

## Command Line

Most examples support multiple graphics APIs (on Windows). They are built with all APIs supported in the same executable,
and the API can be switched from the command line. Use these command line arguments:

- `-dx11` for D3D11
- `-dx12` for D3D12 (default)
- `-vk` for Vulkan

The Feature Demo supports additional command line arguments:

- `-debug` to enable the graphics API debug layer or runtime, and the [NVRHI](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/nvrhi) validation layer.
- `-fullscreen` to start in full screen mode.
- `-no-vsync` to start without VSync (can be toggled in the GUI).
- `-print-graph` to print the scene graph into the output log on startup.
- `-width` and `-height` to set the window size.
- `<FileName>` to load any supported model or scene from the given file.
